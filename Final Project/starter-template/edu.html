          During my time at MSU, I have worked in Python, C++, Java, 	HTML, SQL, and more.
          My freshman year at MSU focused mainly on Python and grasping the main logic of programming.
          Sophomore year, I gained experience with more complex
          languages like C++. Junior year included taking what I had learned my first two
          years and including efficient algorithms and being focused on efficiency. Additionally,
          my minor came more into my education as I began taking classes relating to business IT.
