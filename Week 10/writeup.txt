	I think I will go with styletile2. I made a few options for myself but I believe that my second option will give me the best opportunity to make an impression on someone viewing my site for the first time. Styletile1 I made very quickly, in about 10 minutes, just to get myself acclimated with the new software. I did like the layout I made with the tabs across the top, so I carried that over to the second style tile. I feel that the second tile may have a bit too much text, but just for filler I added Lorem Ipsum text. I think having multiple images in my home page will give the site more depth and draw attention to what I want to accomplish in the site. I definitely spent more time on this sheet, closer to half an hour, to actually get everything where I wanted it to be. I feel like this sheet may look a little too much like a newspaper, but I can adjust it later on.
